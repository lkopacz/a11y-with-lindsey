Hi friends! It's been a hot minute since I wrote a blog post. If you follow me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/LittleKope/status/1101112031355260928) you know that I took a very strategic break in March to work on getting ahead of things! So now I am up and running and I asked some followers what they wanted me to write next!

It sounded like people were curious about my testing workflow! So I'm going to walk you through my thought process, what I test for, how early I test, and how I test!

## Getting started

My testing process begins before I even start writing code! Hopefully, I wasn't siloed away from the designer and had input in design decisions. Even if I didn't, I start looking at the design and how I can ensure that everything is accessible.
