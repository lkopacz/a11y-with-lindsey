Some text.

## React Hamburger Menu

- Talk about some of the features.

1. `npm i react-burger-menu`
2. add it to the layout or app component (whatever works best in your use case)
3. Add some starter CSS to it because it looks like crap right now

```css
.bm-burger-button {
  position: absolute;
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
}

.bm-burger-bars,
.bm-cross {
  background: black;
}
```

## React Modal

What makes a modal accessible:

- Can't focus inside of the modal until it's open
- When modal is open, focus trapping occurs - focus won't be anywhere else on the screen except inside the modal
- closes on esc
- upon close, focuses on the thing it was on last

1. `npm i react-modal`
2. add useState to the component that you're putting the modal in
3. Following the basic instructions to getting a modal setup

- Adding Modal root element
- Adding open and close modal state setting functions
- Add a button that opens the modal
- Add a button inside the Modal component that closes it
- Necessary props to add for a11y - `isOpen={open} onRequestClose={closeModal}`
