I've been wanting to write this blog post ever since I wrote [a11y and JS - A Seemingly Unconventional Romance](./blog/a11y-js-seemingly-unconventional-romance). I love JavaScript, but I primarily work in React. Something I see often is folks (rightly) critique that React Apps are incredibly inaccessible. According the the [WebAIM Million report](https://webaim.org/projects/million/#frameworks), "the adoption of [React] corresponded with [5.7%] more accessibility errors than the average home page."

WebAIM Million tests the sample using the WAVE stand-alone API, and is catching all the crawlable issues. I'm not going to use this blog post to talk about those issues, but if you're interested in learning more about that I've created a [Email Course](https://a11y-with-lindsey.ck.page/b4e437f629) on the topic.

There are two points that I want to drive home about JavaScript frameworks:

> First, at the end of the day, Front End JavaScript Frameworks render HTML. Second, JavaScript frameworks don't produce inaccessible HTML. Web developers produce inaccessible HTML.

I'd recommend before you read this blog post, brushing up on how to fix some common HTML errors.

But for those that are well versed on how to write accessible HTML in React, I wanted to give my peers and colleagues a quick reference of how to use some well supported React packages to create accessible interactive comoponents.

## React Hamburger Menu

- Talk about some of the features.

1. `npm i react-burger-menu`
2. add it to the layout or app component (whatever works best in your use case)
3. Add some starter CSS to it because it looks like crap right now

```css
.bm-burger-button {
  position: absolute;
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
}

.bm-burger-bars,
.bm-cross {
  background: black;
}
```

## React Modal

What makes a modal accessible:

- Can't focus inside of the modal until it's open
- When modal is open, focus trapping occurs - focus won't be anywhere else on the screen except inside the modal
- closes on esc
- upon close, focuses on the thing it was on last

1. `npm i react-modal`
2. add useState to the component that you're putting the modal in
3. Following the basic instructions to getting a modal setup

- Adding Modal root element
- Adding open and close modal state setting functions
- Add a button that opens the modal
- Add a button inside the Modal component that closes it
- Necessary props to add for a11y - `isOpen={open} onRequestClose={closeModal}`
