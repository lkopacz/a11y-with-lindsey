If you haven't noticed, I haven't really been around! It's been almost a month since I posted, and there's been a good reason for that - a Kelly Vaughn, Ali Spittel, Emma Wedekind, and myself [started the LadyBug Podcast](https://ladybug.dev/). We worked really hard to make this come to fruition, and as a result, I've been figuring out how to balance this blog with that side project! Don't worry though, this isn't going away. This is my passion project!

Now that you know where I've been, I've learned a lot about podcasting as well as how that intersects with accessibility, and I wanted to share you some of the things I've learned. I knew some of these things at a high level, but in this post we're going to get a little bit more in-depth.

## Transcripts are a MUST

When we started planning this podcast, it was no doubt we wanted to have transcripts. Starting a podcast can be expensive, both monetarily and time wise, and it can easily be seen as a "nice to have." But I'm here to tell you that they are a must have.

Transcripts have a ton of benefits.

1. Deaf folks or hard of hearing folks can access your awesome content.
1. Some people prefer reading than listening. I cannot tell you how many abled folks have told me they appreciated having transcripts.
1. It helps those whose first language may not be English.
1. If people are reading your transcripts, this means they are spending a ton of time on your site, which ultimately improves SEO.

Being a content creator means that you try to make your content available to as many people as possible. You don't want to alienate a potential audience member because you decided to ignore their needs.

We went through a few tries to getting transcripts, and I wanted to share the options we tried and the pros and cons to each option.

### Having someone do it for you

This was the first thing we tried because it was the only option we knew. We didn't have time to go through our entire audio and write it out. So we decided to hire someone who did that for us. We used Fiverr, which I had never tried before. Hiring someone has pros and cons though.

Pros:

- Paying a real person and supporting someone else.
- Catches errors in real time

Cons:

- Expensive
- Because they are a human, it takes a few days to get them back, which isn't ideal for quick turn around.
- Language differences.

### Using Artificial Intelligence

The other option is to use an AI software to parse through your text and provide a transcript for you. We tried [Trint](https://app.trint.com) and [Otter AI](https://otter.ai), which are both were great tools. AI also has some pros and cons that I'd like to walk through

Pros:

- Get your transcript back in minutes or hours. Otter AI took about 10 minutes.
- Cheaper
- Gets better as they learn your speakers

Cons:

- Especially at first, you have to edit it. We didn't want to have random words in there, so we took some time to listen to the tool as it read the transcript to me.
- Personally, I usually feel a little guilty when I use Machine Learning to replace a job that a person could do.

### What we ended up doing

Because of the quick turn around we needed, we ended up going with AI. We got a deal with OtterAI and ended up using that one. Do what works best for you in the end, all options are great ones!

## A11y Considerations for Custom Podcast Players

I learned so much about how to user React and creating all the audioElement events. Shout out to [Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm/) for having a player that I could play around with.
