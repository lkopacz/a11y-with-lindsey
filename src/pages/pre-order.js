                  As our industry expands to include more self-guided learners
                  and bootcamp graduates, unfortunately, we have to start
                  seeking out accessibility education on our own. Most
                  introductions to HTML classes don't even mention
                  accessibility.

                      The most common accessibility errors and how to fix them
