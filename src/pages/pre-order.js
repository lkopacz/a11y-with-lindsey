                  <p>Accessibility is often glazed over in education. I'm creating a guide of everything I've learned as a self-taught accessibility expert to help bootcampers and self-guided learners.</p>
                  <p>As our industry expands to include more self-guided learners and bootcamp graduates, unfortunately, we have to start seeking out accessibility education on our own. Most introductions to HTML classes don't even mention accessibility.</p>
                  <p>
                    After reading my book, you'll understand:
                    <ul>
                      <li>The crucial takeaways of Accessibility standards, making them less intimidating</li>
                      <li>The negative impact of inaccessible sites and web apps</li>
                      <li>The most common accessibility errors and how to fix them</li>
                      <li>Common interactive patterns in JavaScript (and React)</li>
                      <li>How to comprehensively test</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                  <p>And much more ðŸ¤“</p>
                  <p>I'll be launching the ebook on November 2nd. People who pre-order the book will pay $9.97, which will increase post launch. 15% of all profits will go to the Equal Justice Initiative.</p>
