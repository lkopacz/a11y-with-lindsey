I think that the difficulty in learning accessibility, at least for me personally, was the long Section 508 Compliance reports I used to get when I first started learning about this stuff. It was so stuffy and jargony. Quite frankly, when you receive a wall of all the errors on your site and that report is approximately 40 pages long, addressing those issues becomes quite daunting.

What I challenged myself to do is ask, OK what does this actually mean.
